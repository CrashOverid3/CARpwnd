This tool is intended to be a "Do it all" for CAN-BUS Enumeration, Discovery and Exploitation

One of the main focuses with a "Do it all" is that it will infer certain things to allow it to be used in scripts or by users who are not familiar with it.

In this repo there will be two packages.  One that has everything required baked in to allow for easy usage and one that splits all of the functions up so modifications can be made realy easily.

TODO:
Make it read interfaces,
Make it output read interfaces to terminal,
Make it output read interfaces to file,
make it allow for autosetup of normal can interface,
impliment ICSIM?,
add real puns so I wont be so sad,
